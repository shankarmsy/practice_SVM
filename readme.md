##Work Area for practicing SVM

This is my repo for practicing, learning and demonstrating concepts with Classification & Regression using Support Vector Machines (SVM). I will likely use some of this content to create blog posts (if I come up with something interesting) to share what I've learnt. I also intend to try things out in multiple languages starting with Python and R.
