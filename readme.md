#Work Area for practicing SVM

This is my repo for practicing, learning and demonstrating concepts with Classification & Regression using Support Vector Machines (SVM). I will likely use some of this content to create blog posts (if I come up with something interesting) to share what I've learnt. I also intend to try things out in multiple languages starting with Python and R.

Feel free to use this for your own reference or learning. Just clone the repo or download the .ipynb files. The IPython notebooks can also be viewed online below:
